1. Separate Concerns
UI Code: Should be in the ui module.
Core Logic: Should be in the core module.
Entry Point: Should be in the main script (e.g., hotkey_manager.py).
2. File Structure
Main Script: Contains the entry point of the application.
Core Module: Contains the main logic and controllers.
UI Module: Contains the user interface components.
3. Import Statements
Import only what is necessary for the file.
Keep imports organized (standard library imports, third-party imports, local imports).
4. Function Definitions
Define functions and classes in their respective modules.
Keep the main script clean and focused on initializing and running the application.
5. Initialization
Initialize the main components in the main script.
Pass necessary dependencies through constructors or method parameters.
6. Avoid Circular Dependencies
Ensure that modules do not import each other in a way that creates a loop.
Example Breakdown
Main Script (hotkey_manager.py)
Purpose: Initialize and run the application.
Contains: Entry point, main function, and initialization of main components.
